// Coding Challenge #3
// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculatetheaveragescoreforeachteam,usingthetestdatabelow
// 2. Comparetheteam'saveragescorestodeterminethewinnerofthecompetition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus1:Includearequirementforaminimumscoreof100.Withthisrule,a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
// 4. Bonus2:Minimumscorealsoappliestoadraw!Soadrawonlyhappenswhen both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
